I've been working on Generative Model since 2020 with both academic papers and product deployment in related topic. Currently, I'm a Research Engineer at **Innopeak Technology** working on video understanding algorithm for mobile devices. I obtained my Master degree at [**UCLA**](https://www.ucla.edu/) where I had great fortune to work with [Prof. Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io). Prior to my Master study, I did research at [Intelligent Vision Group (IVG)](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/), **Tsinghua University**, under the guidance of [Prof. Jiwen Lu](http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/) and [Dr. Guangyi Chen](https://chengy12.github.io/). I also had an amazing time at **SenseTime Research** in the topic of GAN and latent space. In December 2020, I received B.S. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at the [**University of Maryland**](https://www.cs.umd.edu/). 

My research interest is in **Computer Vision**, especially **Generative Models**, **Diffusion Models** and **Human Motion Generation**.
